            <h1>About Physics Team</h1>
        </div>
        <p>The mission of TJ Physics Team is simple: to foster a passion for physics. Our officers come into every meeting aiming to share their passion for physics and show the members that physics is beautiful. We aim to spark interest in those who are beginning to learn physics, while providing a training ground for more experienced members. We aspire for every member to take away new insights and improve their problem solving skills at our meetings. In fulfillment of this mission, we have three different teams (A, B, and C) to cater students’ varying abilities, ranging from no experience to a post-AP Physics level.</p>
        <!-- Example row of columns -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>A Team</h2>
                <p>A Team is designed for post-AP Physics students who have already learned or know the traditional classical mechanics that is taught here at TJ. The primary purpose of A Team is to rigorously train students for higher level competitions such as the USAPhO semifinalist exam in the US Physics Olympiad. We offer lectures and challenging problem sets on post-AP mechanics topics, as well as material not covered in AP Physics like thermodynamics, special relativity, optics, waves, and electrodynamics. A fairly deep understanding of multivariable calculus is recommended, but is not required as it will be taught on the go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>B Team</h2>
                <p>B Team is designed for AP Physics students who are looking for help or a supplement to their AP Physics class. For the first half of the year, we will have lectures and problem sets that focus on mechanics in accordance with the AP Physics course. We will also spend some time going deeper than AP Physics in certain areas, and prepare students for the mechanics-based F=ma Exam, which is the equivalent of the AMC 12 exam in the US Physics Olympiad. For the second half of the year, we will cover electricity and magnetism and review for the AP exam in May.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>C Team</h2>
                <p>C Team is designed to foster physics interest in those who have little to no experience in physics. This team is based more on understanding physics from an experimentalist point of view through demonstrations. C Team topics include a brief introduction to topics covered in TJ Physics courses like Physics 1 and AP Physics, as well as additional topics such as optics and thermodynamics. Knowledge of calculus is not required for this team. In addition, C Team also works with our Outreach Committee to organize physics demonstrations at community events, which is explained in more detail below in the “Outreach” section.</p>

            <h1>Initatives</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Collaborative Learning</h2>
        <p>We believe that every member, no matter what their physics background is, can work in a collaborative environment where they can learn from each other and help to improve each other's understanding. To foster this environment of collaborative learning, we offer engaging lectures, collaborative problem-solving sessions, and interactive demonstrations across our A/B/C Team structure.</p> 
        <p>Physics Team was awarded a One Question Grant of $250, the maximum amount, for its innovative projects and initiatives aligning with the 2015-2016 One Question: “How can we foster a sense of community in our inherently competitive TJ environment?</p>

<p>In the 2015-2016 school year, Physics Team started a tutoring program to match our passionate team members to help TJ physics students. This program was based off the motto that “the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else.” The program was so well-received that we expanded our program to math, computer science, biology, and chemistry under the name <a href="http://tutoring.tjhsst.edu" target="_blank">TJ Peer Tutoring</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Outreach</h2>
            
        <p>Physics Team Officers write <a href="http://activities.tjhsst.edu/physics/lecturesB.html" target="_blank">lectures</a> and <a href="http://activities.tjhsst.edu/physics/resources.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study guides</a> for Physics 1 and AP Physics students to help the TJ community beyond Physics Team, and they have received tremendous positive feedback.</p>
        <p>In addition, we also have an <i>Outreach Committee</i> that consists of officers and dedicated club members that work with C Team to manage Physics Team booths at the biannual USA Science and Engineering Festival and TJ Techstravaganza in the second half of the year, in which members can apply the physics they have learned to help foster physics interest among younger students in the local community. After receiving requests from other high schools across the nation, we are also proud to say our lectures are used at other Physics Teams under our name.</p>
        <h2>Diversity</h2>
        
        <p>In an effort to combat the gender gap in physics participation, Physics Team partners with <a href="http://activities.tjhsst.edu/twist/">Tomorrow’s Women in Science and Technology (TWIST)</a> to foster physics interest among women. Physics Team’s Outreach Committee takes an active role in helping set up physics booths at TJ Techstravaganza, which is organized by TWIST. At the same time, TWIST encourages its members to develop interest in physics through attending our meetings and working with us to set up physics booths at TJ Techstravaganza.</p>
