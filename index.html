                We offer engaging lectures,
                collaborative problem solving sessions, and challenging problem sets. Physics Team is geared towards all
                students who want to build upon their physics knowledge. We also encourage these dedicated students to
                participate in competitions such as the National Physics Olympiad and Physics Bowl. In fact, Physics
                Team
                has a proud history of producing more members of the US Physics Team than any other high school in the
                nation. Join us every Friday A Block during 8th period! Since we cater lectures to students' varying
                abilities, you can be sure to take away new insights every week.

                        train
                        students for higher level competitions such as the USAPhO semifinalist exam in the US Physics
                        Olympiad. We offer lectures and challenging problem sets on post-AP mechanics topics, as well as
                        material not covered in AP Physics like thermodynamics, special relativity, optics, waves, and
                        electrodynamics. A fairly deep understanding of multivariable calculus is recommended, but is
                        not
                        required as it will be taught on the go.

                        Physics class. For the first half of the year, we will have lectures and problem sets that focus
                        on
                        mechanics in accordance with the AP Physics course. We will also spend some time going deeper
                        than
                        AP Physics in certain areas, and prepare students for the mechanics-based F=ma Exam, which is
                        the
                        equivalent of the AMC 12 exam in the US Physics Olympiad. For the second half of the year, we
                        will
                        cover electricity and magnetism and review for the AP exam in May.

                        physics.
                        This team is based more on understanding physics from an experimental point of view through
                        demonstrations. C Team topics include a brief introduction to topics covered in TJ Physics
                        courses
                        like Physics 1 and AP Physics, as well as additional topics such as optics and thermodynamics.
                        Knowledge of calculus is not required for this team. In addition, C Team also works with our
                        Outreach Committee to organize physics demonstrations at community events.

                        In the 2015-2016 school year, Physics Team started a tutoring program to match our passionate
                        team
                        members to help TJ physics students. This program was based off the motto that “the best way to
                        learn something is to teach it to someone else.” The program was so well-received that we
                        expanded
                        our program to math, computer science, biology, and chemistry under the name <a
