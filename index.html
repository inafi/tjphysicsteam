        <p class="desc">
            TJHSST's Physics Team has a conducive working environment like no other: we offer engaging lectures,
            collaborative problem solving sessions, and challenging problem sets. Physics Team is geared towards all
            students who want to build upon their physics knowledge. We also encourage these dedicated students to
            participate in competitions such as the National Physics Olympiad and Physics Bowl. In fact, Physics Team
            has a proud history of producing more members of the US Physics Team than any other high school in the
            nation. Join us every Friday A Block during 8th period! Since we cater lectures to students' varying
            abilities, you can be sure to take away new insights every week.

                    Search hospitals, food banks, and testing centers and click on the marker to see their
                    info. Hospitals, food banks, and testing centers will be able to regularly update their pages to
                    provide information such as items they desperately need and awaiting deliveries and donations. These
                    features allow citizens to address any abundance of supplies they might have, by providing a way
                    that people can see which relief centers have inadequate amounts of supplies and its urgency
                    (denoted by the color coding), so people and organizations can donate to the right facilities.
                    Donations by users and organizations, can be tracked and updated through the status and account
                    sections of our webpage.
                    Current cases are also on the map to give perspective.

                    We integrated a system for those with 3D printers to actively contribute to medical facilities who
                    are running short on supplies. Through our account interface, the person in charge of a drop-off or
                    printing facility can upload designs for others to print. Then users can go on the printing page,
                    download the designs, and donate a specific amount. Users can see where the drop-off site is located
                    and when it is open.
